               Enigma Tag Algorithm (ETAl).

Is an alphanumerical id generator with a identifier tag (#).
The (#) tag represents used id on marking data.
Id generated without the tag is classified as untagged id. 
example of both tagged: #3A29T442 and untagged: 3A29T442 .

The ETAl formulae is NANNANNN derived as NAN^2AN^3 so ETAl=NAN^2AN^3

	where A represents alphabets gotten from the authors first name and creator first alias respectively ie first char of both entities.

	where N represents the numeric part of the id 

              where N=M when M is the Mithamo sequential generation concept

		M=n when m represents cronnins concept formulae(ccf) ie 2x+4

		 n=2x+4 when x represents collatz conjecture both even: y/2  and odd: 3y+1/2 . when y represent a number that feed the equation
		   y can be a sequential number or a random generated number.
			in v.1.0 we will test the sequential part of it.

		    so n=2(y/2)+4  or n= 2((3y+1)/2)+4 .
                       so M=n derives final solution N=M and ETAl=N.
	   
           The ETAl has both increment and decrement that concide with the y value if its even it decrements and if its an odd number it decrements. with whole numbers the increment is (++4) and the decrement (--4). This increment and decrements aid in creating a graph to track the id generation sequence.

We introduce a concept of skeletal display and Visual display:

a) skeletal display is the representation of the initial YAYYAYYY ie YAY^2AY^3 nb the Y is the number that is used to feed the ETAl equation.

b) Visual display is the displayed final ETAl id ie NANNANNN ie NAN^2AN^3 nb the Visual display number can be as large as it can eg
     223T2123A34512455 .

Note: We will be working to trancate the Visual display to a limit of 9 .Maybe in v.1.1 on wards the solution will be available.

The ETAl user interface is designed using figma prototyping tool .

The figma design template will be includes inside the prototype folder is need for refrence is required.
